Laravel test assignment

Code pricing module for online wholesale store. 

Every product has its own base price.

While every client can have special price for each product if set by admin

Every client will get to see the base price if his/her for that product is not being set up.

In case a special price is assigned for that client he / she will see a special price. 

You need to code a module where the admin can set up a special price for multiple products for each client.

Since it is a Laravel based assignment please also write migrations. 

You can use a starter kit if you wish to. 

What we need to see is

1- Migrations for the table structure
2- How you write code 
3- Quality of comments
